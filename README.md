# CheatSheet CSS Project
19 September 2022

This repository holds my practice project showing basic CSS and HTML to style a website. The project is from the Full-Stack Developer path on Codecademy.

## What did I learn?
- Structuring HTML content
- Making a modular website with seperate HTML and CSS code
- Using CSS to determine position, sizing, display, etc of items within the box model
- Using font and color to determine the appearence of a website

## What do I need to improve? / Things to think about for future projects
- Better graphic design, the website is simple and static.  I used a preset pallette for the color scheme
- CSS code organization: What is the proper order for the rules? I decided for alphabetic, and a secondary order of specificity (tags followed by the more specific class rules).  This will not work with certain rules such as rules that use link/button state pseudo-classes.
- HTML code organization: What should be a class?  What should be an id?  Is this exclusively determined by the CSS code (which was my decision here)? The project asked for the cheat sheet to be organized around tables, but I also used lists.  I do not like the use of the definition list here; however, a bullet list did not seem much better.  What are some better ways to display list information to the user? Are these displays done more with HTML or CSS?

## What the site looks like
I am uplading an image instead of using github pages since this is a relatively simply practice project.  Hopefully, I will build my skills for more complex websites.
